title: 'Machine Malware Predictoin'
---
**Introduction**

Computers, cell phones, and tablets are affected by malware daily. Nearly one-third of the devices in the world are infected with some form of malware (Mello, 2014). Types of malware include ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can sneakily infect a system when an user clicks on a faulty advertisement or downloads a unknown program. With all that being said, it is important to make sure computer users are taking the necessary precautions to prevent their devices from becoming infected by malware.The goal of this project is to predict likeliness of a Windows machine to be hit by malware soon.

**Data**

The data we used for this project is from [Microsoft Malware Prediction - a Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction). According to Kaggle, the data is gathered from user Windows Defender threat reports. There are 502,583 observations and 83 variables. Because the data set is large, we went through a series of steps to clean the data.

**Conclusion**

Since we had _really_ limited data, these Southwest vs jetBlue insights are purely for discussion purposes. _Nonetheless_, in our analysis of consumer-created Facebook and Twitter content (as of mid-October 2018), data suggests that Facebook and Twitter users have a better perception (sentiment) of Southwest. In addition, the Southwest content indicates more joy and less sadness compared with jetBlue (across Facebook and Twitter).
